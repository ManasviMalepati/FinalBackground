#### Title: A Measure of National Public Transportation

#### Problem: 

The necessity of public transportation in the United States

#### Background: 
One of the major issues with transportation in the United States is the lack of a proper public transportation system. The most common mode of transportation in the U.S. is through cars, which have only been encouraged by the building of highways and freeways. Without a car, it is difficult for a person to live in the United States for one reason: efficiency. This word encompesses many of the difficulties that have to be overcome when using public transport because it measures whether the time spent on the process was maximized with the lowest amount of effort possible. In the case of public transport, neither of these requirements are fulfilled. Public transport is notoriously time wasting and can take even more effort than driving.

An example of this can be seen in the time it takes to get from Newark, DE to Trenton, NJ. In this scenario, you have heard about a family emergency in Trenton and need to start as soon as possible in order to reach your destination as soon as possible. Currently, by car, the trip will take around one hour and 34 minutes. But when you use public transportation, the total time is measured to be seven hours and 54 minutes. This is because schedules are difficult to work around on the weekend since time between modes of transport has increased, making it more difficult to coordinate between two sets of schedules. In order to make it to Trenton, you would first have to take the number 10 bus to Wilmington from 9:50 pm to 10:48 PM, measuring a total of one hour travel time. The next possible train in Wilmington to Trenton is at 4:49 am which means you would have to find lodging until the next day in order to make the next train. The train will take 54 minutes, adding to the total travel time and already going over the time taken by car. It is at 5:43 am the next day that you are able to reach your destination.

When traveling by car, you not only reach your destination sooner but you have spent less effort on driving than changing from a bus to a train and having to spend the night in a possibly unfamiliar city. You also have more freedom and control in planning your schedule and do not have to reach a specific destination by a specific time in order to change transportation. However, not every person has access to a car and relies on public transportation to make their appointments. The truth is, it would be extremely easy to change the public transportation system to be more organized and helpful. By looking over the transportation system and vowing to make it more efficient and accessible for the common person, policy makers could make peoples' lives easier. However, in order for policy to be passed, we must first prove demand and necessity. 

#### Research Questions: 

Is there a demand for public transportation?

This is an important question to ask since this 

Does public transportation require more funding?

Is there a reason to fund public transportation?

    ### Justification for each:
#### Link for dataset: 

https://data.transportation.gov/Public-Transit/Transit-System-Time-Series/h3hh-wfqt

#### Description of dataset:

The dataset includes information collected by the National Transit Database from 2014 onwards. It includes over 190 columns including: Agency, Year, Total Operations Cost, Total Vehicle Maintainence Cost, Total Operating Expenses, and Total of Fares. The dataset's information is organized by NTD id which tracks the specific agency from which the data is collected/reported.

#### Ethical concerns: 

One of the main ethical concerns in studying this dataset is the fact that this dataset is directly connected to helping either justify or condemn the funding of a national public program. Depending on the findings of this analysis, the funding for a program that benefits millions of people can be cut down and result in many people losing the ability to travel.

Customers are not the only people who would be affected by a lack of funding. Those who are employed by the transportation services will lose their jobs which can affect their livelihoods.
